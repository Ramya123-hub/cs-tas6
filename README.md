# 🔐 Password Strength Testing using PasswordMonster

## 📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how password strength varies depending on the length and complexity of a password.  
Using the *PasswordMonster* website, different passwords were tested to analyze how secure they are and how long it would take to crack them.

---

## 🧪 Tool Used
*Website:* [PasswordMonster.com](https://www.passwordmonster.com)  
*Purpose:* To evaluate password strength and estimate the time required to crack it.

---

## 🧭 Steps Performed
1. Opened the *PasswordMonster* website.
2. Entered multiple passwords with varying complexity.
3. Observed:
   - Password length  
   - Character types (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, symbols)  
   - Estimated time to crack  
   - Password strength level

## 📊 Results

| Screenshot | Password Length | Strength Level | Time to Crack | Review Summary |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 🖼 Screenshot 1 | 10 characters | *Medium* | 5 hours | Contains a dictionary word; medium strength |
| 🖼 Screenshot 2 | 18 characters | *Very Strong* | 11,000 years | Excellent security — as strong as Fort Knox |
| 🖼 Screenshot 3 | 7 characters | *Very Weak* | 0.66 seconds | Extremely weak — easily guessable |
| 🖼 Screenshot 4 | 11 characters | *Strong* | 3 months | Good password; reasonably strong |

---

## 💡 Observations
- Passwords shorter than *8 characters* are extremely weak.  
- Adding *uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols* improves password strength significantly.  
- *Longer passwords* (16+ characters) are far more secure.  
- Avoid using *common words, names, or predictable patterns*.

---

## ✅ Conclusion
To create a strong password:
- Use at least *12–16 characters*.  
- Combine *letters, numbers, and symbols*.  
- Avoid *dictionary words or personal information*.  
- Use a *password manager* to generate and store complex passwords safely.
